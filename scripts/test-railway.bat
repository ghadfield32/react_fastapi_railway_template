echo Next steps for Railway deployment:
echo 1. Create two services in Railway:
echo    - Backend service with root directory: backend/
echo    - Frontend service with root directory: frontend/
echo 2. Set environment variables:
echo    - Backend: PORT (automatically set by Railway)
echo    - Frontend: Set VITE_API_URL to your backend service URL
echo 3. Deploy both services
echo.
echo ðŸ”— Useful Railway commands:
echo    railway link    # Link to Railway project
echo    railway up      # Deploy current directory
echo    railway logs    # View deployment logs
echo    railway shell   # Open shell with Railway environment
echo.
